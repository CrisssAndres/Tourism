            <h2>Explore the Iconic El Morro</h2>
            <p>Castillo San Felipe del Morro, known simply as "El Morro," is a 16th-century citadel located at the entrance of San Juan Bay in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Originally constructed by Spanish settlers to defend the city from sea-based attacks, El Morro is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a beloved national historic landmark. With its massive stone walls, strategic vantage points, and preserved cannons, the fortress offers visitors a vivid glimpse into the island’s colonial past and centuries of military history.</p>

            <p>Today, El Morro is one of Puerto Rico’s most popular tourist destinations, drawing families, history buffs, and photographers alike. Visitors can explore its maze of tunnels, barracks, and lookout points while enjoying sweeping ocean views and cool sea breezes. The vast green lawn in front of the fortress is perfect for picnics or kite-flying, and the site’s blend of architecture, history, and natural beauty makes it an unforgettable experience.</p>
